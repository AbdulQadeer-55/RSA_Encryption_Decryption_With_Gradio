# RSA_Encryption_Decryption_With_Gradio

This script demonstrates a simple RSA encryption and decryption app using the Gradio library. Users can input plain text and choose between encryption and decryption using the RSA algorithm. The script generates a key pair, encrypts or decrypts the input text accordingly, and displays the result in the interface.
